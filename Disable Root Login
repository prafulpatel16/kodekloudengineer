After doing some security audits of servers, xFusionCorp Industries security team has implemented some new security policies. One of them is to disable direct root login through SSH.


Disable direct SSH root login on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter.



systemctl status sshd


vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

search /permi

#LoginGraceTime 2m
#PermitRootLogin yes
#StrictModes yes
#MaxAuthTries 6
#MaxSessions 10


uncomment and put NO

#LoginGraceTime 2m
PermitRootLogin yes
#StrictModes yes
#MaxAuthTries 6
#MaxSessions 10


cat/ etc/ssh/sshd_config |grep permit

systemctl restart sshd
